    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>The Warheads are a San Francisco Bay Area production team. Although we are musicians, we specialize in the manipulation, re-arranging, and re-mixing of original compositions, unique sounds, and high-quality audio.</p>

    <p>Recently we have combined elements of world music and computer-based audio electronics into our sound. Working in both old school Analog and new Digital mediums, we focus on the perception of depth and quality of sound within our mixes.</p>

    <p>We prefer real instruments rather than synthesized sounds. Most of the sounds on our projects start out as acoustic instruments recorded to Analog tape. After blending these tracks and sounds together, we further tweak the tracks before transferring them to Digitalâ€“giving us a more organic sound. Then, using the modern mixing elements of Dub and Electronica, we blend our sounds into the final mix.</p>

    <p>All of the musicians on our projects represent the finest and most creative in improvisational performers. Their contribution brings all of The Warheads music to life.</p>

    <p>Finally, Radical Sound Recording Studio and its support of The Warheads cannot go unmentioned. We also must acknowledge the time and effort of Ron K and his engineers; their work allowed each recording to sound its best.</p>

    <p>Since this site was started a year ago much has happened. Our projects have received airplay all over the world on various broadcast and Internet radio stations so first we would like to thank all of the programmers who were kind enough to present our tracks to a wider audience.</p>

    <p>We also received many great reviews for Funk n' Gandhi and Bandit Queen. You can check them out on Raves.com, jazzreview.com, Regenmag.com and properlychilled.com.</p>

    <p>This past summer we licensed 14 tracks to WATER MUSIC RECORDS. These tracks were released under the title TANTRA REMIXED. This is the reason they are no longer available for download on their projects pages. We do however continue to offer all the rest of our tracks and artwork free for downloading and are pleased that you have taken advantage of this. But we can no longer offer the CDs themselves. We have run out and have no plans at this point to manufacture any more for any of the projects.</p>

    <p>We are now in the studio working on new projects so check back for up dates. Please write us and tell us what you think and of course pass along our projects to anyone to whom you think would dig it. Ron K and myself would like to thank all of you for your support and interest in our work and we hope to have new tracks for you in '08.</p>

    <p>JRS 10/19/07</p>

    <p>Since our last update The WARHEADS have continued to release a number of projects 19 to date. These were all recorded at our second studio THE TRENCHES in San Francisco. All of theses projects are recorded and assembled using REASON 4 and REASON RECORD.</p>

    <p>Our newest RADICAL SOUND STUDIO project RE-IN-FUSION was released in April of 2010. And a second project is scheduled to be released later in 2010.</p>

    <p>We have also signed a digital distribution deal with BFM DIGITAL who has helped in making all of our projects(26) available at a number of on line music sites worldwide. The result of this is that we will no longer offer our project for free download as we have done for the past 5 years. If you as listeners enjoy our music projects then please support our efforts by purchasing a track or two. All of the proceeds go directly to paying the musicians that work on our projects.</p>

    <p>As always Ron K and myself thank all of our listeners for their continued support.</p>

    <h2>Recording Info</h2>

    <p>Changes in recording technology have brought us many challenges in the recording of the Warheads projects over the years. In earlier times, We were dealing mostly with Analog Tape. Although it sounds very nice, Editing was always a problem. Early digital recording equipment had a very harsh and thin digital sound quality. Eventually we have settled on using both Analog and Digital recording mediums - Analog for its sound properties, and Digital for its editing capabilities.</p>

    <h3>WARHEADS 1989-1994</h3>

    <p>Most of these Tracks were Recorded "Live" in our first recording room in San Francisco's Mission District.</p>

    <p>All of these tracks were recorded on a Tascam TSR8 1/2" Analog Tape Machine. Although somewhat crude in terms of the equipment used, and production value. Many of these tracks represent some bold musical statements and some audio experimentation. We blended elements of structure and improvisation with acoustic and electronic mediums.</p>

    <p>Since we only had 8 tracks to work with, Many tracks were Recorded simultanously live in the room. We had to submix tracks together to fit all the musicians and instruments onto 8 tracks. This was usually done to drum tracks. This would allow us some level adjustments of the individual instruments and players within the final mix. All of these tracks were recorded live in 1 room with all kinds of signal bleed on each of the other tracks. Seperation was impossible.</p>

    <p>Essential Equipment: Tascam TSR8 Tape Machine, Yamaha mixing console. Sennheiser 441 and 421, AKG C-414, Microphones.</p>

    <h3>THE WARHEADS</h3>

    <p>Technological advancements had moved us right into the digital revolution. We moved our studio into a larger space, and had a separate control room to monitor the tracks we were recording. These tracks were primarily recorded on the ADAT system. Although we engineered with an Analog mindset, We were recording the music on a Digital tape machine. We started using tube Pre-Amps and Compressors to warm the signal. We also used plenty of audio experimentation. - psycho-acoustic phase manipulation, tape looping, and extreme compression and equalization. Many of the sounds on these tracks had gone through some sound previous sound manipuation before we ever got our hands on them. We Had A DJ, Synthesist, and early music computer programmers coming down to our studio to lay down tracks. Many of these tracks were piled on top of each other with little regard to what the final songs would sound like. The final mix would decide the final versions of these songs. Usually we would end up with 24 audio tracks on one song, Many of the sounds on these tracks were completly un-related. While the musicians were recording the overdubs, They would be given some basic instructions as to the direction of the piece of music, But would not listen the underlying tracks they were recording onto. The final mixing was a challenge, As we could not see the tracks on a computer screen. Nor did we have mix automation. We had to mix entirely by "feel".</p>

    <p>Essential Equipment: Lexicon Jam-Man, Lexicon PCM-80 and PCM-90 Multi Effect Units. Alesis ADAT, Manley Tube Pre-Amps. Demeter VTCL Tube Compressor. Drawmer 1960 Tube Compressor. TC Electronics Parametric Equalizer. Neumann U-87, Electro Voice RE-20, AKG C-414 Microphones.</p>

    <h3>Warheads - "KILLED IN ACTION"</h3>

    <p>After many years of experimentation, we set out with a goal of having more "Song" related material. The songs on this disc represent over 5 years of evolution until the final versions were decided upon. This disc was our first to use computer editing. All these tracks were initially recorded on an Otari MTR-90 24 track analog tape machine. in 2002 we transfered these tracks onto a "Pro Tools" system and began editing together various versions of these songs. Eventually we decided "Pro Tools" did not have the sound quality we were looking for. We eventually switched over to a PC using Magix Samplitude software. We used Apogee digital convertors and Re-transfered the original analog tracks to Samplitude and edited the final versions of these songs.</p>

    <p>Essential Equipment: Magix Samplitude, Lynx Technology AES-16, Apogee AD16 - DA16, Manley Vari-Mu Compressor, GML 8200 Parametric Equalizer, Telefunken V-72 Preamps.</p>

    <h3>The Warheads Sextet - "CRASH AND BURN"</h3>

    <p>Recorded entirely on a Roland MC-505 Groovebox. What started out as a experiment with a new piece of equipment. We ended up deciding that the original tracks in the simplest form worked the best.</p>

    <p>Essential Equipment: Roland MC-505 Groovbox.</p>

    <h3>FUNK N GANDHI</h3>

    <p>An entirely new approach had us blending Indian scales, Theories and Harmonies with Funk and Dub backbeats. These tracks started out with a drum machine, electric bass and an old Rhoads keyboard. All other tracks were layered as overdubs. Deepak Ram's - Bansuri (wooden flutes) were recorded with a Manley tube microphone and a Focusrite Red 7 Pre-Amp.</p>

    <p>Essential Equipment: Hammond B3 Organ with Leslie 122 cabinet. Rhoads Electric Piano. Fender Deluxe Reverb Guitar Amplifier. Focusrite Red 7 and ISA 110 Pre-Amps. Manley Gold Reference Tube Microphone. Neumann U-87, KM-184, and TLM-193 Microphones. Magix Samplitude.</p>

    <h3>BANDIT QUEEN</h3>

    <p>Our first recording with Vocals. The basic idea was laid back Chill-Out Grooves with elements of Jazz, R &amp; B, Soul, and Dub. Originally tracked on the Otari MTR-90 analog machine, These tracks took on new life after we transfered them into Samplitude. Using cut and paste, and looping, We were able to transform these songs into thier current form. Grace's vocals were recorded with an old Neumann U-47 tube microphone and a GML Pre-Amp.</p>

    <p>Essential Equipment: Heritage 576 Jazz Guitar, Fender Deluxe Reverb Guitar Amplifier. Hammond B3 Organ with Leslie 122 Cabinet, Rhoads Electric Piano, Amek 9098 Pre-Amp EQ's. Manley Massive Passive EQ's. Empirical Labs Distressor and Fatso compressors. API 312 Pre-Amps. Neve 33115 Pre-Amps. GML Pre-Amps. Neumann U-47 vintage tube microphone.</p>
